# SURE Program Experience

The codes in this branch show the normal and adversarial training of models in the RGB and HSV space using DenseNet and ResNet models in Pytorch.  

Knowledge that was acquired: 
 * Pytorch and Kornia library 
 * Adversarial training
 * PGD Attack
 * Mounting Google Drive
 * Use of GPU
 * Research of state-of-the-art networks (DenseNets and ResNets)
